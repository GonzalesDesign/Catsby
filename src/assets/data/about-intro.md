## Alley Cats

### On a dark alleys in Japan, comes an organize crime boss that controls all strays.

To locate Cat Alley head to the station for the Senko-ji cable car 15 minutes walk from Onomichi Station. Turn left as you reach the entrance of the Senkoji cable car ticket office and follow this path up the hill to the start of Cat Alley. A geometric cat painted on a local door is the first sign that you are in the right place.Â
